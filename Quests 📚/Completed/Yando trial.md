TOURNAMENT

POST ODARA AWAKENING: 

Feizan of the rising sun - testimony:
"during the ritual he did feel sth
sth was behind them 
presence
he saw a crystalisk scaly wtih patterns 
fluffy and odd
he saw evil trying to break through
purple-redish-darkish colour
screams out = worse
hurt the crysalisk 
connection to the 
darkness around
higher than a building 
cry for help"
